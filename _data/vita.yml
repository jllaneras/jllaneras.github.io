experience:
    - title: DevOps Engineer @ ING Belgium
      start: May 2015
      end: Nov 2017
      location: Brussels (Belgium)
      sector: Banking

          Building the Home'Bank private website for retail customers
      long_description: |
          ING Belgium is the Belgian subsidiary of the ING Group, an
          international banking company.

          My team was in charge of revamping Home'Bank, the retail
          customer website, using modern technologies. We also used Agile
          practices, like the Scrum methodology, continuous delivery,
          pair programming, code reviews, etc. I worked on the home page
          of the Home'Bank website where the customers can check the
          status of their accounts. I also worked on the Investments and
          User Settings web applications.

          Even though I helped a bit with everything, my primary role in
          the team was to create the necessary REST APIs that integrate
          with multiple back-end services, cache the data when possible,
          and serve it in a convenient format to front-end applications
          running in the web browser.

    - title: Full Stack Web Developer @ European Schoolnet
      start: Apr 2012
      end: May 2015
      location: Brussels (Belgium)
      sector: Education

      short_description: >
          Building web applications and services to support the network of
          European Ministries of Education
      long_description: |
          European Schoolnet is a network of 31 European Ministries of
          Education. As a non-profit organization, it aims to bring
          innovation in teaching and learning to its key stakeholders:
          Ministries of Education, schools, teachers, researchers and
          industry partners.

          I was part of the technical team dedicated to support the other
          teams in the organization, composed of about 80 people. We created
          and maintained the necessary infrastructure, tools and web
          applications that enabled us to, not only sustain the network of
          European Ministries of Education, but also to develop websites and
          web applications for the European Commission and some industry
          partners.

          I worked both as front-end and back-end web developer.

    - title: Full Stack Web Developer @ 3digits
      start: Jun 2007
      end: Apr 2012
      location: Palma (Spain)

          Building a wide variety of intranet and extranet applications
          mainly for the public administration but also for private
          companies
      long_description: |
          3digits focuses mainly on developing software projects for the
          public administration of the Balearic Islands (Spain), even though
          I also worked on projects for international companies (like
          [Hotelbeds](https://corporate.hotelbeds.com/about)) and for
          smaller local companies as well (e.g. online shops).

          Among other projects, we also open sourced
          [IBKey-Device-Manager](http://ibkey.sourceforge.net/?idioma=en_EN),
          a Java library to abstract away the access to digital certificates
          contained in different device types and the generation and
          verification of digital signatures used in web applications we
          developed for the public administration.

          During my job at 3digits I worked on a wide range of projects
          covering all the phases of the software life cycle: planning,
          implementation, testing, documentation , deployment and
          maintenance.
