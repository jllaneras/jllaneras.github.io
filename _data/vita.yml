    - title: Software Consultant @ Proton VPN
      start: May 2022
      end: Present
      location: Remote from Brussels (Belgium)
      sector: VPN services

          Rewriting the Linux app for Proton VPN.
      long_description: |-
          Proton VPN is one of the leading VPN providers. Our main focus
          is on privacy, security and speed.

          As a software consultant, I'm leading the development of the v4
          Linux app for Proton VPN.

          The v4 app is already used in production. We went from around 4K
          daily users with the v3 app to currently (data from March 2024)
          around 22K daily users with the v4 app.        

          The goal when I joined was to do a full rewrite of the v3 app used
          to connect to any of the thousands of VPN servers distributed around
          the globe. The main focus when writing the v4 app was its modular design
          to allows us replacing/swapping its building blocks easily and safely,
          and to test them independently.

          The full VPN client is written in Python, and the front-end is based
          on GTK. The VPN connection backends rely on NetworkManager due to its
          ubiquity in most linux distributions.

          The main challenge of the project is having to support the wide variety
          of Linux distributions that people is using, which required us to
          invest heavily on automated testing in environments built with Docker
          and launched via GitLab CI.

          Technologies that I'm currently using at Proton are for example: Python,
          Gtk, NetworkManager, OpenVPN, Wireguard, systemd, GitLab, Debian/Ubuntu and
          Fedora.


    - title: Software Consultant @ Ion Beam Applications
      start: May 2021

          Python development for Proton Therapy R&D.
      long_description: |-
          Ion Beam Applications (IBA) is an international company providing
          Proton Therapy Systems (PTS) to treat cancer.

          As a software consultant, I'm currently working mainly as a solo
          developer, in collaboration with the hardware teams, building
          software for PTS R&D projects.

          The goal of the first project on which I worked was to gather raw
          signal data from the PTS cyclotron, process it, run different
          analysis, an publish the results to Splunk, for monitoring and data
          analysis purposes.  This project was developed with Python.  The main
          challenge was the amount of data to process. For that, I used
          different Python processes using the multiprocessing Python module
          and shared memory for IPC, and to avoid duplication of data in RAM. I
          used docker and systemd to deploy and run the software.

          Another project I also briefly worked on is a Qt Python desktop
          application to characterize radio frequency signals. The goal of the
          project is to develop a solution to calibrate PTS systems during
          installation/maintenance in an automated way.

          Technologies that I'm currently using at IBA are for example: Python,
          Qt, systemd, Numpy, Pandas, CherrPy, Splunk, PostgreSQL, Docker,
          Java, Spring and Ubuntu.


    - title: Software Consultant @ ENGIE Laborelec
      start: May 2019

          Python development for Street Lighting R&D.
      long_description: |-
          Laborelec is a Belgian research centre owned by
          [ENGIE](https://www.engie.com/en), a French multinational utility
          company.

          As a software consultant, I was in charge of building software for
          several R&D projects run by the Street Lighting department of
          Laborelec. In this mission, I worked mainly as a solo developer,
          rather than in a team.

          The first project on which I worked was code-named LightBox. For this
          project I shipped a desktop application, developed in Python and Qt,
          to make quality controls on batches of street lighting lamps bought by
          ENGIE.

          Another project was the Street Lighting Inventory. In this project I
          delivered a GIS application to gather and process geolocalization and
          spectral data from street lighting in urban areas and inter-city
          roads. The application was based on QGIS. Raw data was loaded to a
          PostgreSQL database with bash scripts and the data processing was done
          with stored procedures and the PostGIS database extension.

          Some technologies I used while working at Laborelec were: Python,
          Qt, Flask, pytest, pyinstaller, Git, Bash, Elastic Search, Kafka,
          Docker, Postgres, PostGIS and Ubuntu.

          Setting up a software factory for AGC Glass.
      long_description: |-
          As a software consultant, I led a team of 5 people to set up a
          a software factory for Glass division of the AGC group, one of the
          worldwide leaders in glass production and manufacturing.

          We set up a continuous integration pipeline with GitLab integrated
          with Jira, and worked on a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate
          a typical Agile workflow. We set up a Kanban board on
          Jira to define user stories, derive tasks from them, and automatically
          open Gitlab merge requests. Code pushed to the Git repository would
          be tested against a set of unit and integration tests. It was also
          scanned with static analysis tools like Sonar, application versioning
          was also automated with Gitlab and binaries were stored in a binary
          repository.

          Regarding the proof-of-concept project to show case the software
          factory, we shipped a templatable CRUD web application and a Java
          backend supporting different databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and
          SQL Server) as the storage layer.

          The technology stack we used was Spring (Java) and Docker on the
          back-end. The front-end application was developed with vanilla
          ES6 Javascript and bundled with webpack and NPM.

          Building the Home'Bank private website for retail customers.
      long_description: |-
          ING Belgium is the Belgian subsidiary of the ING Group, an
          international banking company.

          My team was in charge of revamping Home'Bank, the retail
          customer website, using newer technologies. We used Agile
          practices, like the Scrum methodology, continuous delivery,
          pair programming, code reviews, etc. I worked on the home page
          of the Home'Bank website where the customers can check the
          status of their accounts. I also worked on the Investments and
          User Settings web applications.

          Even though I often had the role of lead/facilitator in the team,
          my primary role was to create the necessary REST APIs that integrate
          with multiple back-end services, cache the data when possible,
          and serve it in a convenient format to front-end applications
          running in the web browser.

          The back-end stack I implemented was Java-based, following a
          microservice-style architecture. We also used Kafka as the
          event bus for some back-ends, and Cassandra mainly as a caching
          layer.

          Building software to support the network of European Ministries of
          Education.
      long_description: |-
          European Schoolnet is a network of 31 European Ministries of
          Education. As a non-profit organization, it aims to bring innovation
          in teaching and learning to its key stakeholders: Ministries of
          Education, schools, teachers, researchers and industry partners.

          I was part of a small technical team of 5 people dedicated to support
          the other teams in the organization, composed of about 80 people. We
          created and maintained the necessary web applications that enabled us
          to, not only sustain the network of European Ministries of Education,
          but also to develop websites and web applications for the European
          Commission and some industry partners.

          As an example, I built web applications for the eTwinning online
          platform, so that teachers in different countries can organize 
          online collaboration events.

          I worked both as front-end and back-end web developer. The back-end
          stack was Java-based using Servlets/EJBs, often using Oracle or MySQL
          for storage. The front-end was implemented with plain web
          technologies.

          Building software for the public administration.
      long_description: |-
          3digits focused primarily on developing software projects for the
          public administration of the Balearic Islands (Spain), like
          intranet applications and online citizen services.
          However, I also worked on projects for international companies like
          [Hotelbeds](https://corporate.hotelbeds.com/about) and for
          smaller local companies as well (e.g. online shops).

          During my job at 3digits I worked on a wide range of projects
          covering all the phases of the software life cycle: planning,
          implementation, testing, documentation, deployment and
          maintenance.

          Back then, one of my favourire projects was to open source
          [IBKey-Device-Manager](http://ibkey.sourceforge.net/?idioma=en_EN),
          a Java library to abstract away the access to digital certificates
          contained in different device types and the generation and
          verification of digital signatures used in web applications we
          developed for the public administration.

          The stack I worked with was Java-based. I also maintained
          Oracle Forms/Reports applications and did lots
          of database programming in Oracle and MySQL.
